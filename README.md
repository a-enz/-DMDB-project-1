TRANSLATOR HOWTO
----------------

1. IMPORTANT: i have set an absolute path variable which you need to change for your system. The path variable can be found in the `MySQLConnection` class in the `Test()` method and is called "saveInDist".
2. You need the most recent version of the DB (not that important, should still work on older)
3. To actually translate stuff do the following steps (run on server -> use your browser to visit our crime-homepage which will initialize the MySQLConnection for the first time -> everything should happen automatically and the translated files should apear in the specified folder)
